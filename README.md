This is a repository for student assignments in FYS3150 - Computational Physics at University of Oslo.

Project 1 is about getting familiar with vector and matrix operations while solving the one-dimensional Posson equation, and comparing the results with the LU decomposition. 

Project 2 aims at developing Jacobi's rotation method for solving eigenvalue problems. We use the same matrix as last project (tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix) because it has analytical eigenpairs and to verify the method's efficiency. 

In project 3 we compare Verlet's algorithm against Euler's forward algorithm while we model the solar system. In this project we try to build an objective orientede code, because the task is based on several ordinary differential equations where the basic equations are pretty similar. 

We study phase transitions with the metropolis algorithm in project 4.

In project 5 we simulate and model a face-centered cubic lattice with the velocity verlet algorithm.
